## About

### Submission Guidelines

Submissions **must** meet the following criteria:
- Submissions are license-compatible with FlightGear (i.e GPLv2 or later) and _do not violate the terms of these licenses_
- Submissions are hosted and developed on GitHub (_strongly preferred_), GitLab, GitTea, Gogs etc. - **not SourceForge or Google Code, they're a very poor experience for end-users**

### Gold Medal

The gold medal emoji (ü•á) is a slightly subjective indication. It's not a competition or anything, just a seal of approval or quality control, essentially a way for me to vouch for a projects quality. It generally means most or all apply to a project:
- The project that has reached a significant level of maturity (stable, active development, good user experience) 
- The project is 'showcase' quality and is (among) the best in its class, or the benchmark by which similar projects are held
- I've personally tested the project thoroughly enough and for long enough to be able to vouch for it

The lack of a gold star doesn't necessarily indicate anything negative about a project, I may simply not have gotten time to review it thoroughly yet.
